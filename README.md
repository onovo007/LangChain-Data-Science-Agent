Data Science Agent Using LangChain
This repository contains the Python implementation of a Data Science Assistant Agent leveraging the LangChain framework, designed to assist users in complex data science tasks.

Overview
This Data Science Agent uses advanced NLP capabilities provided by LangChain to perform a range of tasks, including data analysis, model interpretation, and answering domain-specific queries. The agent can process user instructions, conduct relevant data operations, and produce insights using integrated machine learning workflows.

Features
Natural Language Processing: Efficiently interprets natural language commands.
LangChain Integration: Seamlessly integrates with LangChain tools to perform complex data science operations.
Interactive: Engages users through interactive queries, ensuring smooth and intuitive data exploration.
Python-based Workflow: Built using Python, making it easy to customize and extend.

Installation
To use the agent, ensure you have Python and the required packages installed:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langchain pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage
Run the notebook or python script to activate the agent:
bash
Copy
Edit

python data_science_agent.py
Interact with the agent via the console or Jupyter notebook interface by providing natural language instructions, such as:

"Analyze the dataset and provide a summary."
"Build a predictive model for stroke risk."
"Visualize data distribution."
